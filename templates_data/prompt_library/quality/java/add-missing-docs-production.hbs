Add comprehensive JavaDoc with HUMAN CONTENT FIRST, then AI metadata.

STRUCTURE:

1. HUMAN CONTENT (Top ~80 lines - for humans):
   - Class JavaDoc with overview and purpose
   - Quick start examples
   - Public API list
   - Common errors and solutions
   - Real usage examples

2. SEPARATOR in class JavaDoc:
   ---
   <h2>AI Navigation Metadata</h2>
   <p><i>The sections below provide structured metadata for AI assistants, graph databases (Neo4j), and vector databases (pgvector).</i></p>

3. AI METADATA (Below separator in JavaDoc):
   - Module Identity (JSON in {@code} block)
   - Architecture Diagram (Mermaid as text)
   - Call Graph (YAML as text)
   - Anti-Patterns
   - Search Keywords

Keep existing docs unchanged.

Code:
```java
{{code}}
```

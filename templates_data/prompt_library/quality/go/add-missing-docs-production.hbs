   - Quick start examples
   - Exported API list
   - Common errors and solutions
   - Real usage examples

2. SEPARATOR in package comment:

   ## AI Navigation Metadata
   The sections below provide structured metadata for AI assistants, graph databases (Neo4j), and vector databases (pgvector).

3. AI METADATA (Below separator in package comment):
   - Module Identity (JSON in code comment)
   - Architecture Diagram (Mermaid)
   - Call Graph (YAML)
   - Anti-Patterns

Keep existing docs unchanged.

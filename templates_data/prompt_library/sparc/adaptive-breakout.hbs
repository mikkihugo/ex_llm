ESCALATION TRIGGERS:
- Confidence < 60% after 2 attempts
- Unknown domain or technology
- Conflicting requirements
- Complex edge cases
- Resource constraints

RESPONSE FORMAT:
=== ESCALATION_ASSESSMENT ===
Trigger: [what caused escalation need]
Complexity: [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL]
Standard_Flow_Adequate: [YES/NO]

=== COORDINATION_REQUEST ===
Required_Expertise: [domain experts needed]
Additional_Research: [tools/resources needed]
Estimated_Effort: [time/complexity estimate]

=== FALLBACK_STRATEGY ===
If coordination unavailable: [alternative approach]
Minimum viable solution: [acceptable baseline]

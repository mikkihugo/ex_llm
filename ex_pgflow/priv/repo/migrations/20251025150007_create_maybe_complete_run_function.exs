defmodule Pgflow.Repo.Migrations.CreateMaybeCompleteRunFunction do
  @moduledoc """
  Creates pgflow.maybe_complete_run() for checking and completing workflow runs.

  Matches pgflow's implementation:
  1. Check if all steps are completed (remaining_steps = 0)
  2. If yes, mark run as completed
  3. Aggregate outputs from leaf steps (steps with no dependents)
  4. Set run.output to aggregated leaf outputs

  Called by complete_task() when a step completes.

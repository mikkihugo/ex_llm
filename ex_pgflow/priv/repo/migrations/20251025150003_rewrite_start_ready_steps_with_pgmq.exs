defmodule Pgflow.Repo.Migrations.RewriteStartReadyStepsWithPgmq do
  @moduledoc """
  Rewrites start_ready_steps() to use pgmq for task coordination.

  Matches pgflow's architecture:
  1. Find ready steps (remaining_deps = 0)
  2. Mark as started
  3. Create step_tasks records
  4. Send messages to pgmq queue

  This is the KEY function for pgflow parity - uses pgmq for work distribution!

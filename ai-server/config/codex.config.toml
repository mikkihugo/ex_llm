# Codex Configuration for Singularity Integration
#
# This config disables Codex builtin tools so ALL tools come from
# Elixir via MCP. This ensures:
# - Tools have access to knowledge base
# - Tools have access to quality standards
# - Tools have access to templates
# - Tools operate on real codebase (not sandbox)
# - All operations go through Elixir orchestration

[builtin_tools]
# Disable ALL built-in tools (use MCP only)
include = []

# Alternatively, you can exclude specific tools:
# exclude = ["local_shell", "read_file", "write_file", "list_dir"]

# MCP servers will provide all tool functionality
[mcp_servers.singularity]
# url = "http://localhost:4000/mcp"  # Elixir app MCP endpoint
# Uncomment when MCP integration is ready
